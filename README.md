# Citi-Bike-Analytics
Visualizations using Tableau

Using the data found in the Citi Bike Trip History Logs analyse to find insights about the following:

* How many trips have been recorded total during the chosen period?

* By what percentage has total ridership grown?

* How has the proportion of short-term customers and annual subscribers changed?

* What are the peak hours in which bikes are used during summer months?

* What are the peak hours in which bikes are used during winter months?

* Today, what are the top 10 stations in the city for starting a journey? (Based on data, why do you hypothesize these are the top locations?)

* Today, what are the top 10 stations in the city for ending a journey? (Based on data, why?)

* Today, what are the bottom 10 stations in the city for starting a journey? (Based on data, why?)

* Today, what are the bottom 10 stations in the city for ending a journey (Based on data, why?)

* Today, what is the gender breakdown of active participants (Male v. Female)?

* How effective has gender outreach been in increasing female ridership over the timespan?

* How does the average trip duration change by age?

* What is the average distance in miles that a bike is ridden?

* Which bikes (by ID) are most likely due for repair or inspection in the timespan?

* How variable is the utilization by bike ID?

* Use your visualizations (does not have to be all of them) to design a dashboard for each phenomena.
* The dashboards should be accompanied with an analysis explaining why the phenomena may be occuring. 



*  A static map that plots all bike stations with a visual indication of the most popular locations to start and end a journey with zip code data overlaid on top.

*  A dynamic map that shows how each station's popularity changes over time (by month and year). Again, with zip code data overlaid on the map.

* The map you choose should also be accompanied by a write-up unveiling any trends that were noticed during your analysis.



* Create a Tableau story that brings together the visualizations, requested maps, and dashboards.
